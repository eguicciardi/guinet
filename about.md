<p class="lead">I'm a result driven web developer with more than 10 years experience in custom projects development.</p>

From complex company websites to ecommerce solutions and ad-hoc software platforms both desktop and mobile.

My areas of expertise are Drupal and Wordpress development, deployment and hardening. Data interaction between systems and bug fixing.

I like simple, clean and maintenable code and I deeply care about the code I write and the code I've been asked to look behind.

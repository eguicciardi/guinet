<p class="lead">I'm a result driven web developer with more than 15 years experience in custom projects development.</p>

My areas of expertise are **Drupal** and **Wordpress** development, deployment and hardening. Data interaction between systems and bug fixing.

I like simple, clean and maintenable code. I deeply care about the code I write and the one I've been asked to look behind.

Currently I'm head of DevOps and senior developer at [Tesecom](https://www.tesecom.it) in Pisa.
